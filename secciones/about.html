          <h2 style="text-align: center">Why work with me</h2>
          <div class="wsite-space"></div>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Because I thrive on creating space where people experience security
            and freedom for sincere and effective communication. The main reason
            people work with me is because they want to reset their
            relationships and culture for trust and collaboration. They are
            confident they will find practicals tools for deep and meaningful
            conversations, allowing to refine purpose, reconnect, co-create and
            innovate their ways of working and living.

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            I bring a natural presence, humor and deep hope to my work. Hope for
            a world, where humans have the conversational intelligence to shift
            from separation to connection. I am deeply concerned with the
            communication breakdowns we experience on so many levels and the
            consequences this has on our relationships, our organisations, our
            politics and our planet.
          </p>
          <div class="wsite-space"></div>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Through my work I am blessed to witness that with skillful
            conversations transcending borders is possible - at a deeper level
            we are the same - when we meet at this place the new can emerge and
            be born into this world. We can start over and reestablish
            relationship to work together, create and bring forth change that
            serves everyone.

          <h2 style="text-align: center">​My approach</h2>
          <div class="wsite-space"></div>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            I am fascinated by research and practical approaches contributing to
            people’s personal and collective growth, resilience and thriving. My
            work is nourished by Neuroscience, Positive Psychology, Mindfulness
            and even Yoga. However, the most influential approach, informing my
            work as a coach, mediator and facilitator is Marshall Rosenberg’s
            Nonviolent Communication (NVC).

            Since 2006, I have been studying with a wide variety of local and
            international trainers, among which I am particularly grateful to:

          <div class="wsite-space"></div>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            John Kinyon and Ike Lasater for their ground breaking work and
            teaching in the field of NVC mediation; my inspirational teacher
            Martha Lasley, the pioneer in blending Coaching with NVC in the
            service of personal and organisational transformation; Miki Kashtan
            for her modelling and strong commitment towards radical social and
            organisational change, as well as her sharing of revolutionary
            approaches in group facilitation, collaborative decision making and
            difficult conversation management. In addition to the mentioned NVC
            trainers, I also would like to acknowledge Judith Glaser, for
            developing the framework of Conversational Intelligence (C-IQ),
            which allows me to apply the wealth of new insights in Neuroscience
            to NVC and my everyday conversations.
